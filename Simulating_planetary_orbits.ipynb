    "# Simulating Planetary Orbits\n",
    "\n",
    "Author: Ethan Huang Kao\n",
    "\n",
    "Date: 13th of December, 2022\n",
    "\n",
    "Completed as part of PHAS0007 Computing Final Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Isaac Newton, any two masses experience a force of attraction between them. The force experienced by these objects is given by Newton's Law of Gravitation [1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{F} = G \\frac{m_1 \\times m_2}{\\vec{r^2}}$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "where G is Newton's gravitational constant which is approximately $6.6743 \\times 10^{-11} N m^2 kg^{-2}$. This equation can also be expressed in the following vector form [1]:\n",
    "$$ \\vec{F}_{12} = -G \\frac{m_1 \\times m_2}{|\\vec{r}_{21}|^2} \\hat{r}_{21}(1)$$\n",
    " \n",
    "Thus, the acceleration of object $m_1$ small in mass caused by $m_2$ can be found using the following equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{F} = m_1 \\times \\vec{a_1} (2)$$\n",
    "$$ -G \\frac{m_1 \\times m_2}{|\\vec{r}_{21}|^2} \\hat{r}_{21} = m_1 \\times \\vec{a_1} (3)$$\n",
    "$$ -G \\frac{m_2}{|\\vec{r}_{21}|^2} \\hat{r}_{21} = \\vec{a_1} (4)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation (1) is subbed into equation (2) to give equation (3). We can see that the masses of $m_1$ cancel out to give equation (4). This means that the acceleration of the small object is only dependent on the mass of the large object ($m_2$) and the distance between the two objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now consider Euler's method of a decreasing step size. If we assume that the acceleration of $m_2$ on $m_1$ is constant for a small time step $dt$, we can use projectile motion equations to calculate the objects changing velocity and changing position. The following equations can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{v} = \\vec{u} + \\vec{a_1} \\cdot dt$$\n",
    "$$ \\vec{r} = \\vec{r_o} + \\vec{u}\\cdot dt$$\n",
    "\n",
    "I will first investigate the force experienced by one planet by one star. This investigation will be followed by illustrating how two planets would interact with each other in the prescence of a star's gravitaitonal field. We will then investigate how best to animate a system of a star, planet, and a moon. Finally, I will touch on the three-body problem and investigate how changing initial parameters can drastically change the outcome."

    "#### C2: Analysis\n",
    "As we can see from the two animations above, changing the initial parameters will drastically change the motion of the objects. Although they seem to ressemble each other, we must look at the range of the axis. Even a slight visible change in the animation would suggest a massive change if observed in person.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this notebook we have illustrated different types of planetary orbits. We have concluded that changing any parameters, no matter the number of celestial bodies, will result in some change of the outcome. As an extension, one could further increase the number of celestial bodies or try to add a z-component to the animation to deal in 3-dimensions."
