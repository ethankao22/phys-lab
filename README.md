This respository contains Python notebooks used in Ethan Huang Kao's academic studies at UCL Department of Physics and Astronomy in pursuing a MSc Physics degree

1. Hubble_constant_Ia_supernovae.ipynb
- Created a weighted amd unweighted line of best fit for recession velociy against distance to calculate Hubble's constant.
- Submitted as the mid-term assingment for PHAS0007-22/23 "Computing" (Nov. 18th, 2022)

2. planks_constant.ipynb
- Deriving Plank's constant from the photoelectric effect. Contains calculations for Plank's constant and the work function. Followed by error propogation and chi-2 calculations.
- Submitted as part of the lab report for PHAS0007-22/23 "Experimental Laboratory" (Jan. 11th, 2023)

3. Simulating_planetary_orbits.ipynb
- Using animation (matplotlib.animation) to illustrate how two planets would interact with each other in the prescence of a star's gravitaitonal field. Followed by an investigation on animating a system of a star, planet, and a moon. Finally, illustration of the three-body problem to investigate how changing initial parameters can drastically change the outcome.
- Submitted as the final assingment for PHAS0007-22/23 "Computing" (Jan. 13th, 2023)

4. xray_scattering.ipynb
- X-Ray reflection to find the spacing between planes of atoms
- Submitted as coursework for PHAS0008-22/23 "Practical Skills 1P" (Mar. 13th, 2023)
